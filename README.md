### Description

Tired of scrolling through dozens of streams of LoL, Dota, WoW, Hearthstone, etc. when you already know you're not interested?

Let's clean up your Twitch directory.

Simply hover a game and click the close button, it won't show up again until you remove it from your blacklist by opening the menu in the address bar.
