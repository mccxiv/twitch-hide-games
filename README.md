#Twitch hide games

Hide games you don't care about when browsing streams on the Twitch website.
**Note:** someone beat me to it and released an extension that performs the same task, a day before me.  
I'll leave this one as "unlisted" in the store. I won't be maintaining this project but it was a learning experience

### Description

Tired of scrolling through dozens of streams of LoL, Dota, WoW, Hearthstone, etc. when you already know you're not interested?

Let's clean up your Twitch directory.

Simply hover a game and click the close button, it won't show up again until you remove it from your blacklist by opening the menu in the address bar.
